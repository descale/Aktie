# This config file contains file names that should not be shared
# by Aktie even if a share contains files with such a name.
#
# Each file name needs to be listed on a new line
# without any leading or trailing whitespace.
#
# The file name may not contain the system specific path separator
# (usually '/' or '') and should not start with '#'.
# Malformed file names are ignored by Aktie.
