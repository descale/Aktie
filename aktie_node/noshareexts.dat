# This config file contains file extensions that should not be shared
# by Aktie even if a share contains files with such an extension.
#
# Each extension needs to be listed on a separate line
# without leading or trailing whitespace.
#
# A file extension needs to start with a '.'
# followed by at least one of the characters 'a-z', 'A-Z' '0-9' and '_'.
# Other characters should not be part of a file extension.
# Malformed file extensions are ignored by Aktie.
#
# The extensions '.aktiepart' and '.aktiebackup' are never shared
# by Aktie and do not need to be specified here.
